    "text": "Project Title: Consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics of marine ecosystems under the wake of global change\nFunding: National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research Synthesis Grant\nPrincipal Investigators: Mack White, Bradley Strickland, Jennifer Rehage, Deron Burkepile, Joey Peters\n\n\n\nMarine Consumer Nutrient Dynamics LTER Synthesis Working Group aims to address questions at broad spatiotemporal scales using long term population data from a number of different ecosystems\n\n\nIncreases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events as a result of global change are altering population and community dynamics of marine animals. Given that animals are key recyclers of nutrients in many ecosystems, these ecological impacts may have consequences for ecosystem function. Consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (CND) are an integral part of biogeochemical cycles, but to-date long-term studies are lacking. Without long-term data across large spatial scales, it is difficult to predict how ecosystems will respond to disturbances. The synthesis group plans to estimate CND over broad spatiotemporal scales by integrating empirical models of consumer nutrient excretion and egestion with time-series of consumer populations across ten marine and coastal LTER sites. They will address two main objectives:\n\ncharacterizing spatiotemporal patterns in the magnitude and variability of CND and;\nevaluating the resilience of CND to variable disturbance events.\n\nThis is a revised proposal based on positive feedback of the group’s 2018 submission and input from colleagues during a cross-site workshop at the 2022 LTER ASM. With funds from LTER LNO, this diverse working group will synthesize LTER data to improve understanding of CND over broad spatiotemporal scales under the wake of global change."

    "title": "Data Agreement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The following agreement has benefited greatly from and contains significant portions of templates/information derived from peer-reviewed literature (i.e., Cheruvelil et al., 2014; Boland et al., 2017) and formalized data policies (i.e., Soil Data Harmonization & Synthesis, Arctic Data Center, Environmental Data Initiative). Each of these resources were used in consideration of the LTER data requirements for synthesis working groups. This policy is a living document that may be revised to reflect changes in working group participants, datasets, and project goals while ensuring compliance with the LTER derived data requirements per our funding agreements.\nBackground: It is well established that collaborative synthesis research elicits a deeper and more holistic understanding of our natural world. In this synthesis effort, we will use publicly available data published in peer-reviewed articles, and data from unpublished sources. Detailed metadata and a thorough understanding of each dataset will be necessary to link them across sites in a single database. As such, the cooperation and collaboration of scientists with intimate understandings of their respective datasets/sites will be critical to generating accurate research products. Furthermore, we believe that the working group will greatly benefit from the intellectual contributions of a team of scientists with diverse research backgrounds.\nThis project will synthesize multiple data sources. This includes, but is not limited to data published in publicly available databases, data which is publicly available but are protected via prior data sharing agreements, and those which are not publicly available. The primary purpose of this document is to facilitate clear understanding of how data will be (1) used and (2) shared. It is expected that perspectives and technologies concerning data will change through conversations with working group participants and any revisions to the data policy will result from discussions with the entirety of the working group and if changed, promptly be updated in the project-specific website. We look to the SOils DAta Harmonization (SoDaH) & Synthesis working group to differentiate data at different tiers of manipulation (see below):\n\n*modified from SoDaH working group workflow figure\nRaw data (Tier 0) in their native format, alongside metadata will be housed in the working groups google drive and R scripts for data wrangling will be archived in LTER working group GitHub repository to facilitate data harmonization (Tier 1), aggregation, and dataset end-products (Tier 2). The derived database will be managed by the database manager, Li Kui (UCSB, lkui@ucsb.edu). The database manager and principal investigators (Mack White; mwhite@fiu.edu, Bradley Strickland; bstrickland@vims.edu, Jennifer Rehage; rehagej@fiu.edu) are the only individuals with authority to modify the Tier 2 data and will only do so if necessary. Any modifications to the Tier 2 will be summarized in GitHub and available for review by all working group participants and collaborators. Working group participants and collaborators are not allowed to share or make available in any form data contained within the database during the duration of the project, unless discussed with the entirety of the working group.\nData package: The final datasets (Tier 2) will be published as a data package through the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). All Tier 0 data will be acknowledged as data sources for the final data package.Participants who provided Tier 1 data will be invited to be coauthors on the data package (see more details in the authorship agreement).We strongly suggest that each data provider publish their individual dataset (Tier 0 or/and Tier 1) separately through EDI. This will ensure that each dataset can be properly cited and read directly into R script for analysis. To ensure high quality metadata, we expect data owners to provide written metadata with appropriate column attributions, sampling methods, temporal and spatial coverage, and data distribution preference (e.g., cite in the final data package as a data source or specific intellectual right?). The co-authors of the Tier 2 data package are expected to review and ensure that content and format in the final data package are both accurate and consistent across sites. \nGitHub:All analyses will be conducted in R. Some data reports may be generated through Rmarkdown. All code for analysis and visualization will be shared on the working group GitHub repository. Final versions of the analysis scripts, upon publication of the manuscript, will be made publicly available."

Furthermore, we believe that the working group will greatly benefit from the intellectual contributions of a team of scientists with diverse research backgrounds.\nThe primary purpose of this agreement is to ensure that the process of determining authorship for scholarly products derived from the working group is done consistently and transparently. The synthesis work involves collaborations and contributions primarily at two stages: 1) creating a synthesis database (Tier 2 data, see data agreement), and 2) The data analysis and drafting of the manuscript. The authorship lists at these two stages will be separated to distinct the primary contributions. \nAuthorship of the database used in the manuscript:We will publish the final database as a data product. To document the process and acknowledge the contribution, authors for the data product will be invited to opt-in, and the invitation will be sent to the anyone who helped to harmonize and aggregate the raw data to cross-site dataset (Tier 1 data), or who developed the data structure for the aggregated dataset and help to concatenate site data (Tier 2 data). The people who contribute to the Tier 0 will be acknowledged in the data package and the link from the Tier 0 data will be cited as the data source for our final data package. \nAuthorship of the manuscript: We look to the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) which has established a clear set of standards for authorship currently used by a number of scientific societies. Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT, see list below) includes the roles typically associated with contributions to scholarly outputs. Given the nature of our synthesis efforts, roles will be used to aid in determining: 1) criteria for authorship and 2) authorship order to be evaluated by the primary author - if similar contributions exist, order will be determined by reverse alphabetical order. Individuals (regardless of their career stage or formal affiliation with the working group) who serve two or more of the following roles via their contributions will be solicited for opt-in authorship on resulting research products by the primary author via email with a deadline to accept or decline:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptualization\nResources\nWriting - original draft\n\n\nData Curation\nSoftware\nWriting - review & editing\n\n\nFormal Analysis\nValidation\nSupervision\n\n\nMethodology\nVisualization\nInvestigation\n\n\nProject administration\nFunding acquisition\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for accepting authorship: Individuals accepting authorship should only do so if they are willing and able to commit the time necessary to be actively involved in the research process as outlined by the list above. We will use an opt-in model of authorship, where all authors approve the final version and document their contribution at the time of submission. The inclusive list of potential authors will be guided by early, often, and open discussion such that authorship for the manuscript is mostly determined before the first draft of any manuscript is complete and ready for review. This being said, substantial contributions (see CRediT roles above) at any point in the publication process (i.e., conceptualization to full acceptance by a peer-reviewed journal) will warrant an invitation for co-authorship. Author contributions should be documented and tracked in the “Contribution Spreadsheet” (located on the Working Group Google Drive) for transparency.  \nGeneral guidelines for the primary author:The primary author shall be very inclusive in soliciting potential co-authors for opt-in authorship. Primary authors will provide a draft of the manuscript to all co-authors and maintain frequent communication at each step in the review process, providing a final version of the manuscript to each of the co-authors once it has been submitted. At decision time, the primary author should forward the decision and reviews to all coauthors. As the working group begins wrapping up work and planning publications, the primary author will be responsible for facilitating communication with LNO Director Marty Downs and LNO Communications Officer Gabe de la Rosa so they can anticipate outreach opportunities and assist in communicating results to diverse audiences.\nGeneral guidelines for co-authors: Each potential coauthor is expected to make substantial contributions to the manuscript. If you feel that someone should be added to the author list, send their contact information and rationale for inclusion to the primary author. Potential co-authors should acknowledge receipt of the draft manuscript and note whether they wish to be included as an author within a reasonable period set by the primary author (i.e., 2 weeks). If they do not respond in this time and after the primary author has made a reasonable effort to contact them (e.g. follow-up email and/or phone call), then they will be omitted as an author so that the manuscript can proceed. Co-authors that are interested in reviewing the manuscript should make this known along with a reasonable timeline for completing the review and returning any comments. All authors must provide feedback and revisions in a timely manner. If the manuscript has not been returned in the stated timeframe and after the primary author has made a reasonable effort to contact them (e.g. follow-up email and/or phone call), the primary author may decide to proceed without the feedback from the co-author."
