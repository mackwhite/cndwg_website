In this synthesis effort, we will use publicly available, data published in peer-reviewed articles, and data from unpublished sources. Detailed metadata and a thorough understanding of each dataset will be necessary to link them across sites in a single database.

Remember that providing data is only one of at least two required contributions for co-authorship on peer-reviewed journal articles prepared by the group (see authorship agreement). We expect each data provider to collate data, write metadata, provide appropriate attribution information, and review and approve the final data package.\n\n**GitHub**\n\nAll analyses will be conducted in R.
